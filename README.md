# SHAP-SHAPLEY-Values
Code and our presententation and collaboration during the Artificial Intelligence Seminar organised in Barcelona by the UPC &amp; URV Universities. 
SHAP/Shapley Values


This repository provides an implementation and examples of SHAP/Shapley values, a popular method for interpreting the predictions of machine learning models. SHAP values are based on cooperative game theory and provide a unified framework for understanding the contribution of each feature to a model's output.

What are SHAP/Shapley Values?
SHAP/Shapley values are a concept from cooperative game theory that aims to fairly allocate the contribution of each player in a cooperative game. In the context of machine learning models, SHAP values provide an explanation of how much each feature contributes to the model's prediction for a specific instance. They offer a comprehensive way to understand the importance and impact of individual features on model outputs.

This repository includes an implementation of SHAP/Shapley values for various types of machine learning models, including:

Linear models
Tree-based models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting)
Deep neural networks
Ensemble models
Features
